/// A placeholder installation function for test helpers.
/// 
/// This function is typically used in the context of Zig's build system and testing
/// framework to set up test infrastructure or register test utilities. In this minimal
/// implementation, it performs no operations but provides an entry point that can be
/// called during test setup or module initialization.
///
/// # Usage
/// This function is often called from build scripts or test configuration files
/// to initialize test helper functionality before running tests.
